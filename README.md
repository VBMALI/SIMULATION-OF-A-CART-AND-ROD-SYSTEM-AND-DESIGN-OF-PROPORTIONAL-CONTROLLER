# SIMULATION-OF-A-CART-AND-ROD-SYSTEM-AND-DESIGN-OF-PROPORTIONAL-CONTROLLER
- This project aims at creating signal-based math model in Simulink for linearized version of original non-linear model of cart and a rod system and then developing a proportional controller design for the cart to follow the commanded position. Thus, the project involves deriving the differential equations, writing a MATLAB script and building a mathematical model for simulation and control of the system. Some level of model verification is also shown in the project.
- In this project, first of all, the differential equations of system using Newtonian approach have been derived.
- Then, the non-linear system is converted to linear system which is simulated. Further, this linear system is simplified in order to build a proportional controller on it.
- Proportional control design approach is discussed and documented and is verified against different reference inputs provided to the system for the position of the cart.
- Also, some aspects of this system such as comparison between approximated decoupled model and true coupled model response is discussed.
